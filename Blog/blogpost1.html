            <p id="minibio">Brooke Bachman attended Flatiron Bootcamp and currently lives in Denver, CO. She is a frontend web developer currently looking for her next opportunity to contribute in a <u>major way at a startup!</u></p>
            <article id="blog-content">
                <p>In the past 3 years I have learned more about myself than I have in the past 20. I have finally found a career that inspires me. I have a career path that makes working 8-10 hours really fun. </p>
                <p> In 2017 I graduated college with a degree in Communication Studies and a minor in Women Gender studies. <u>When I graduated I felt the pressure to get a full-time job, yet I had no clue what career sounded good to me and I was qualified for. </u> My mom, dad, sister, and family have all worked in Sales. Whenever my boyfriend Jinoo would ask me what I wanted to do for a career I would feel completely hopeless. He worked throughout college and found the exact job he has always wanted and is on a path to have the career he has wanted since he was a child- to be a CEO. </p> 
                <p>When I was younger I wanted to be a movie star. I always envied Jinoo's passion and tenacity. He would work all night long, on weekends, and do whatever it took to get the job done. He would learn new skills while working full time. I, on the other hand, was very resigned. So I decided to follow in my parents' footsteps and got a Sales job at a contract manufacturer. I had a wonderful manager and the Vice President was like a mentor to me. After 6 months of working there my stepdad who was really a second dad to me passed unexpectedly. I left that job to heal and be with my mom.</p> <p>I did side work and even tried a UX course at General Assembly. In the Ux course, I learned how to evaluate products and processes that were beneficial to users or detrimental. Ux was not quite the right fit for me, however, I did create an awesome project called Opal. </p>
                <p>I felt lost again, and could not figure out what to do with my life. So, I decided to try Sales again, my family said I would do great at it. I had great mentors at that company. I was even able to sit in on product sprints. I got to know a lot of the designers, engineers and product managers at that company. When I sat in on the sprints, I had good ideas and I loved the aspect of problem-solving. Shortly after my company was relocating my Sales department to Texas. </p>
                <p>I did not go to Texas and instead felt it was important to really see where my passion lies, and find a career where my natural skills could be useful. On June 28 I went up to Jinoo and asked him how I could learn to code. He gave me some resources and I spent that whole day learning. I went up to him and asked him what was next, he said he was so surprised, and he had not thought of what would be next. He suggested I apply for a coding Bootcamp. </p>
                I did meticulous research on all of the top in-person boot camps in the Bay Area. I showed interest in the main ones, and they followed up with a phone call. I had 10 questions that I had prepared. I was interviewing them as much as they were interviewing me. I finally made the decision to attend Flatiron Bootcamp. I chose it for the work-life balance, the feelings Fridays, and their impressive full-time employment placing once the Bootcamp ends. <p>I am 2 weeks away from finishing the Bootcamp as I write this. Remember that project Opal I created 2 years ago? I am now building the application for Opal, I already own opalbirth.com so when I host my final project it will be on my own site. I am so so thankful that I tried a bunch of jobs, and even failed at some of them. My journey felt hopeless for years and I felt like I would be bad at the things I truly wanted to do. I always secretly dreamed of being an engineer, but I did not think I could do it. </p> <p> After making it through this Bootcamp I know I have made the right choice. I love coding, I love creating, I love problem-solving. I finally feel like I have a career that supports my dreams. I get to build out an application that I have been dreaming about for 2 years. </p>Never give up, if you are not in love with your job, dig deep and figure out what you actually want to do. What excites you and scares you. I am so thankful for my journey, all the things I have tried, and hard work I have put in is finally paying off. I am so proud of myself and could not have done this without the support of Jinoo and my family.</p>
